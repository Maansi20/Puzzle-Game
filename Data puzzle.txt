Overview: Generate a complete Python script for a memory game based on the Primordium theme using the Pygame library. The game should include the following features:

1. Game Setup:

Create a window with a customizable size (e.g., 800x600 pixels).
Initialize Pygame and set the title of the window to "Primordium Memory Game".
2. Game Board:

Design a grid representing the memory cards (e.g., 4x4 or 6x6).
Each card should be visually drawn in the Pygame window and initially displayed face down.
3. Card Design:

Use unique Primordium-themed "images" for each card pair.
Cards should have a distinct color for the back side and a clear design for the front side.
4. Player Turns:

Allow players to flip a card by clicking on it, revealing the image.
Keep track of the player's turn (Player 1 or Player 2).
5. Input Handling:

Detect mouse clicks on the card grid.
Prevent clicking on already flipped cards.
6. Matching Logic:

If two flipped cards match, keep them face up and mark as matched.
If they do not match, flip them face down after a short delay.
7. Win Condition:

Display a victory message when all card pairs have been matched.
Include options to restart the game or exit.
8. Reset Option:

Provide a "Play Again" button to restart the game with the same settings.
9. Graphics and Design:

Include basic Pygame event loop for handling input, updating game state, and rendering.
Ensure clarity in the game's visuals, including different colors for unmatched and matched cards.
10. Testing and Debugging:

Test the game for functionality, ensuring all rules and logic are implemented correctly.

The game is now running and you should see a window with the Primordium Memory Game. Here's how to play:

• Click on cards to flip them over and reveal their symbols
• Try to find matching pairs of symbols
• When you find a match, the cards stay face up and you get a point
• If the cards don't match, they flip back over and it's the other player's turn
• The game ends when all pairs are found
• The player with the most matches wins

Game controls:
• Press R to reset the game
• Press ESC to quit

Enjoy the game! The window should be open now, showing the 4x4 grid of cards with the Primordium theme.
